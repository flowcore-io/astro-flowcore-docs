description: How our services are structured

Here is a guide on how we structure our services. Each section broken down into a specific part of the service.

## Overall
Before we dive into the structure of each element in the service, we'll first look at the overall structure of the service.

If you would like to dive through some example code, then you can can check it out here https://github.com/flowcore-io/bun-service-example
