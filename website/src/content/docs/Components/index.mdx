The Flowcore CLI is a command-line tool that allows you to interact with Flowcore from the terminal. Currently it can
only be installed via NPM.

## Install the Flowcore CLI

You can install the Flowcore CLI by running the following command:

```bash
npm install -g @flowcore/cli
```

Install the Flowcore component plugin

```

Use the Flowcore CLI to create a new component

flowcore component add <type>/<name>
```

```
