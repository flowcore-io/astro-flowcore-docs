API Exceptions is a library that provides a collection of exceptions, useful for generating descriptive error messages in your API.
Additionally, the library provides a way of extending the provided roster of exceptions with your own exception implementations.
If you run into exceptions that you think would be useful for others, please consider joining our [Discord](https://discord.gg/8ZcjtmSB) and sharing your ideas.

## Install the API Exceptions

```bash
flowcore component add library/api-exceptions
```

<details>
  <summary>Or install the API Exceptions manually</summary>

  Create a `api/exceptions.ts` file in your project's lib folder, and add the following code:

    ```typescript
    /**
     * Base class for all API exceptions. This class extends the built-in Error class and adds properties for HTTP status code and error code.
     * 
     * @property {number} status - The HTTP status code for the exception.
     * @property {string} code - The error code for the exception.
     * @example
     * ```ts
     * // example exception implementation
     * export class ApiNotFoundException extends ApiException {
        public status = 404
        public code = "NOT_FOUND"
    * }
    * ```
    * ```ts
    * // example usage
    * throw new ApiNotFoundException("User not found", "user", { id: "123" })
    * ```
    */
    export abstract class ApiException extends Error {
        public status = 0
        public code = ""
    }

     *
     * @property {number} status - The HTTP status code for the exception, which is 409.

    export class ApiConflictException extends ApiException {

    }

     * @property {string} code - The error code for the exception, which is "INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR".
     */

     *
     * @property {number} status - The HTTP status code for the exception, which is 404.
     * @property {string} code - The error code for the exception, which is "NOT_FOUND".
     */
    export class ApiNotFoundException extends ApiException {
        public status = 404
        public code = "NOT_FOUND"

     *
     * @property {number} status - The HTTP status code for the exception, which is 401.
     * @property {string} code - The error code for the exception, which is "UNAUTHORIZED".
     *
     * @param {string} message - The error message for the exception.
     */
    export class ApiUnauthorizedException extends ApiException {
        public status = 401
        public code = "UNAUTHORIZED"

        constructor() {
            super("Unauthorized")
        }
    }

    export class ApiUnprocessableContentException extends ApiException {
        public status = 422

        public on?: string
        public errors?: Record<string, string>

            super(message)
            this.on = on
            this.errors = errors
        }
    }
    ```

## Usage

There is a set of exceptions that you can use - all of which are utilised in roughly the same way.
So in the example below, we're throwing an `ApiForbiddenException` which is a 403 error.

```typescript
throw new ApiForbiddenException("You are not allowed to access this resource")
```

## Extending the API Exceptions

You can extend the API Exceptions with your own exceptions. This is useful if you run into exceptions that you think would be useful for others.

```typescript
// my-custom-exception.ts

export class ApiMyCustomException extends ApiException {
  public status = 418
  public code = "I_AM_A_TEAPOT"
}

// usage
throw new ApiMyCustomException("I'm a teapot")
```
