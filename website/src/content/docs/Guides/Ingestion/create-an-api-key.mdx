To generate an API key, [navigate to your organization settings](/guides/organization/navigate-to-organization-settings), and scroll down to __Api Keys__

<Image alt={"Overview of all your current API keys"} src={ApiKeyOverview}/>

Then press the __Create Api Key__ button, and you will be prompted to create a new key.
Then name it whatever makes sense to you, as this name holds no significance to the key itself.

Finally, after you press __Create Api Key__, you will be presented with an auto generated key. This is the only time you will see the key, so make sure to store it in a safe place, before closing this window.

And there you have it! You have successfully created an API key, that you can use to authenticate your [ingestion channels](/guides/ingestion/ingestion-options)

Keep in mind that you can always [delete the created key](/guides/ingestion/delete-an-api-key), and create a new one if you feel that it has been compromised.
