To delete an API key, navigate to your organization settings, and scroll down to Api Keys

On the right hand side of the api key, you will see the delete button. Pressing it will delete the api key.

<Card title={"Users of the key lose access"} icon={"warning"}>
    Keep in mind that when you delete an API key, all requests that utilise this key will immediately fail, as they are no longer authorized to access the ingestion channel

    So if you choose to delete an API key, make sure to distribute a new one to any and all services that you think rely on it.
