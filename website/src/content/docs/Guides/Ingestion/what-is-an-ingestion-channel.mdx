After [creating a data core](/guides/3-data-core/2create-data-core), then you'll want to start sending data to the data core. This is where ingestion comes in.
Ingestion specifically refers to the process of sending data to a data core. Essentially exposing your data core to the outside world, in one of the [available ingestion options](/guides/4-ingestion/2ingestion-options).

Because this process essentially exposes your data core to the outside world, it means that you are __required to secure your ingestion channel__ before usage. This is done by [creating an API key](/guides/4-ingestion/3create-an-api-key).
