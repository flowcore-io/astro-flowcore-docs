After [creating a Data Core](/guides/data-core/create-data-core), then you'll want to start sending data to the Data Core. This is where ingestion comes in.
Ingestion specifically refers to the process of sending data to a Data Core. Essentially exposing your Data Core to the outside world, in one of the [available ingestion options](/guides/ingestion/ingestion-options).

Because this process essentially exposes your Data Core to the outside world, it means that you are __required to secure your ingestion channel__ before usage. This is done by [creating an API key](/guides/ingestion/create-an-api-key).
