## Generate a new Application

To generate a new Flowcore NextJS application, run the following command:

```bash
flowcore new nextjs-app <app-name>
```

This will scaffold a new NextJS application that is built using the Flowcore IDD approach and ready to use for the Flowcore Platform.

:::note
This will generate a new directory with the name of the application. Inside the application directory, you will find a
new NextJS application that is ready to use for the Flowcore Platform.

## File Structure

The generated application is based on the [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/). Below are the files relevant to the Flowcore Platform:

<FileTree>

- flowcore.yaml flowcore manifest file, this is used to define the deployed scenario and its resources
- flowcore.local.development.yaml flowcore local development configuration file, this is used when streaming locally
- translations
  - en.json english translation file
  - generate-typings.js typings file generator, this is used to generate the typings for the translations
- README.md
- src
  - components
    - **Header.js**
  - â€¦
- pages/

</FileTree>
