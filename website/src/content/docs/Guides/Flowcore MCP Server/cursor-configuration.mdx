## File based MCP Server configuration

To configure the Flowcore MCP Server via a file based configuration, you can create the following `.cursor/mcp.json` file for a specific project or globally at `~/.cursor/mcp.json` for all projects:

```json
{
  {
  "mcpServers": {
    "flowcore": {
      "name": "Flowcore MCP Server",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@flowcore/platform-mcp-server@latest",
        "--serviceAccountId",
        "<your-service-account-id>",
        "--serviceAccountKey",
        "<your-service-account-key>"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

:::note
The global configuration only works for cursor version 0.47.x and above.
:::

:::tip
For cursor it is recommended to enable `yolo` mode as that will streamline the process of calling MCP commands. Just keep in mind to instruct cursor what is allowed to be run automatically. in order to avoid running malicious commands.
:::

:::caution
The `serviceAccountId` and `serviceAccountKey` can currently only be generated by the Flowcore team. Please reach out to us if you need access to the Flowcore MCP Server.

  The command to add in the command field is:
  ```bash
  npx -y @flowcore/platform-mcp-server@latest --serviceAccountId <your-service-account-id> --serviceAccountKey <your-service-account-key>
  ```
</li>

<li>
Click on the "Save" button to save the MCP Server configuration.
</li>

<li>

## Enabling Ingestion for a specific project

To enable ingestion through the MCP Server for a specific project, you can follow the steps below.

you need to use this configuration in the project's `mcp.json` file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "flowcore": {
      "name": "Flowcore MCP Server",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@flowcore/platform-mcp-server@latest",
        "--serviceAccountId",
        "<your-service-account-id>",
        "--serviceAccountKey",
        "<your-service-account-key>",
        "--apiKey",
        "<your-api-key>"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

You can also use this in the global `mcp.json` file to enable ingestion for all projects, but it will be limited to the tenant you have created the api key for.
