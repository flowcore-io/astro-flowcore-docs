As Flowcore is a platform for building event sourced systems, it is important to understand how to handle PII in a secure and compliant way.

:::note
  PII is a feature that the tenant has to enable in order to use it, and it is disabled by default.

## PII in Flowcore

Event Types can be marked as containing PII data when it is created or after it has been created and data has been ingested.

The key features of the PII handling are:

- PII Key path
  The JSON path to the field that identifies the entity that this event is related to. This is used to mark an entity as needing to be removed or scrambled.
- PII Mask
  The schema to use when scrambling PII fields, this is a complex schema that can be used to ensure that the scrambled data match the original data in structure to ensure that systems using it do not break.
- PII Activation
  A system can mark an entity as needing to be removed or scrambled by using the `PII Activation` feature through the Flowcore SDK.
- PII Permissions
  the `pii-access` permission can be used to control access to PII data, this is explicitly required for any api key or user that needs to access PII data, otherwise it will be scrambled upon access. This is regardless of whether the entity has been marked as removed or not.

:::danger
  When an entity is marked as removed or scrambled, it will be scrambled upon access regardless of the permissions. This is not reversible.

## PII Platform Concept

Flowcore ingests data as-is and automatically manages both cold and hot storage. When data is accessed or extracted:
- If the entity has been activated, PII fields are removed or scrambled.
- If the caller lacks the `pii-access` permission, all PII fields are scrambled.
- Otherwise, original PII data is returned.

## Viewing PII-enabled Event Types

When PII masking is enabled for an event type, you'll see a shield icon next to its name in the list:

:::tip
  If you hover over the shield icon, you can see the schema that is used to scramble the data for that event type.
