2. Scroll down to the **Features** section and locate **Sensitive Data**.

3. Toggle the switch to **On** to enable Sensitive Data for your tenant.

4. Click **Save Changes** at the bottom of the page to apply your settings.

Once Sensitive Data is enabled, you can mark event types or activate Sensitive Data on entities using the Flowcore SDK.

:::note
  Sensitive Data is disabled by default, so you need to enable it in the tenant settings before you can use it.
