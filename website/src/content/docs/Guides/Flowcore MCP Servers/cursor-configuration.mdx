## MCP Server Prerequisites

Before you can configure Cursor to use the Flowcore MCP Server, you need to have the following prerequisites:

- A Flowcore Personal Access Token (PAT)
- A Flowcore API Key (for MCP ingestion, this is optional but recommended)

## Flowcore Personal Access Token (PAT)

To create a Flowcore Personal Access Token (PAT), you can run the following CLI command:

```bash
flowcore auth new pat <name you want to give to the token>
```

:::caution
You need to save the token somewhere safe as it will not be shown again.

## Flowcore API Key

To create a Flowcore API Key, you can run the following CLI command:

```bash
flowcore auth new key -t <tenant> <name you want to give to the api key>
```

:::caution
You need to save the api key somewhere safe as it will not be shown again.

## Flowcore Platform MCP Server configuration

To configure the Flowcore Platform MCP Server via a file based configuration, you can create the following `.cursor/mcp.json` file for a specific project or globally at `~/.cursor/mcp.json` for all projects:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "flowcore": {
      "name": "Flowcore MCP Server",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@flowcore/platform-mcp-server@latest",
        "--username",
        "<your-flowcore-username>",
        "--pat",
        "<your-flowcore-personal-access-token>",
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

:::note
The global configuration only works for cursor version 0.47.x and above.

## Flowcore Read Model MCP Server configuration

To configure the Flowcore Read Model MCP Server via a file based configuration, you can create the following `.cursor/mcp.json` file for a specific project or globally at `~/.cursor/mcp.json` for all projects:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "flowcore-local-read-model": {
      "name": "Flowcore Local Read Model",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@flowcore/local-read-model-mcp-server@latest",
        "--username",
        "<your-flowcore-username>",
        "--pat",
        "<your-flowcore-personal-access-token>",
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

:::tip
For cursor it is recommended to enable `yolo` mode as that will streamline the process of calling MCP commands. Just keep in mind to instruct cursor what is allowed to be run automatically. in order to avoid running malicious commands.

Here is an example prompt to use for cursor when enabling Yolo mode:

```
just commands that read and compile are allowed, you can run build commands and you can run any lint command, you can create directories or files but do not call any delete or removal commands without checking with me first please,  When I ask you to delete a Data Core, Flow Type or Event Type you NEED to ask me for CONFIRMATION before executing the tool to actually do the deletion!
```

## Enabling Ingestion for a specific project

To enable ingestion through the MCP Server for a specific project, you can follow the steps below.

you need to use this configuration in the project's `mcp.json` file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "flowcore": {
      "name": "Flowcore MCP Server",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@flowcore/platform-mcp-server@latest",
        "--username",
        "<your-flowcore-username>",
        "--pat",
        "<your-flowcore-personal-access-token>",
        "--apiKey",
        "<your-api-key>"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

You can also use this in the global `mcp.json` file to enable ingestion for all projects, but it will be limited to the tenant you have created the api key for.
