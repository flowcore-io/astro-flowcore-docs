The Flowcore MCP Servers is a set of MCP servers that allows your LLM to interact with Flowcore. It is a simple npm package that your LLM runs locally on your machine to interact with Flowcore. See [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction#general-architecture) for more information on MCP and how it works.

We have the following guides for the Flowcore MCP Servers:

- [Cursor Configuration](/guides/flowcore-mcp-server/cursor-configuration/)
- [Claude Desktop Configuration](/guides/flowcore-mcp-server/claude-desktop-configuration/)

:::note
We are working on adding more guides for other LLMs and IDEs. If you would like to see a guide for another LLM or IDE, please let us know.
