### About

The Flowcore Platform is a developer-focused data infrastructure solution designed for easy creation and deployment of scalable data systems. Key features include:

- Simple manifest-based setup
- Data ingestion via webhooks or filehooks
- Event streaming through CLI, SDK, or on-platform Transformers
- Linear scalability of all components
- Self-use in platform development, demonstrating reliability [^1]

### Primitives

1. Data Core: Main data container, similar to a database instance
2. Flow Type: Collection of data types within a Data Core
3. Event Type: Specific data type container, comparable to a database table
4. Event: Core data unit with metadata, payload, and bi-temporal properties
5. Transformer: Data processing runtime in a transformer shell
6. Strand: Combination of a stream and a transformer
7. Scenario: Collection of strands or services
8. Read Model: Database for storing processed data for specific use-cases

### Best Practices

1. Version all Flow Types and Event Types for easier data management
2. Create simple, single-responsibility services
3. Utilize production data for development and testing
4. Leverage event-driven architecture for decoupled services
5. Use appropriate database types for different read models
6. Follow the platform's versioning system for backward compatibility

The Flowcore Platform simplifies data infrastructure creation while maintaining scalability and flexibility, making it an effective solution for modern, event-driven data systems.
