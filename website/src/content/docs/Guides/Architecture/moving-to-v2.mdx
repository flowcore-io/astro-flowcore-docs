As we are migrating much of our platform to a V2, we will also be moving away from certain APIs and existing solutions.
So as to make the transition as smooth as possible, we will be providing a migration guide for each of the changes.


## Leaving GraphQL behind
We are moving away from GraphQL and moving to a combination of a RESTful approach and an SDK.


### SDK
If you wish to use the SDK, then you please refer to the [npm documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@flowcore/sdk), or the [jsr documentation](https://flowcore.github.io/jsr/) for more information.


### RESTful API
If you wish to use the RESTful API, then you please refer to the equivalent rest api endpoints:

|Domain|New Endpoint|
|---|---|
|`Flow Type`| https://flow-type-2.api.flowcore.io/swagger|
