description: Reset an adapter in Flowcore using the Flowcore CLI
---

You can reset an adapter in Flowcore using the Flowcore CLI to run from a set moment in time.

## Reset Adapter

To reset an adapter, you can use the `flowcore reset adapter` command. This command will reset the specified adapter, to a specified moment in time.
You can think of it as a rewind button for your adapter, allowing you to rewind to a specific point in time, and replay all the events that have occurred since then.

:::caution
If your adapter is processing the events into an already existing data storage, you need to make sure that your transformation logic is able to handle re-entries.

For example, you can check if the payload within the event already exists in your data storage, and if it does, you can skip the event, or handle it as a re-entry.

This is generally a good design for when have your transformation logic, to always support replays.
:::

```sh
flowcore reset adapter adapter-name-or-id -s scenario-name -t tenant-name -b bucket-name -e event-id
```

If you wish to use the adapter id, you can read about how to obtain your adapter id [here](/guides/flowcore-cli/get-resources-cli).

### Flags

|argument|abbreviation|required|description|
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|`--scenario`|`-s`|Yes|The scenario the adapter resides in. You can obtain all your scenarios within a tenant [here](/guides/flowcore-cli/get-resources-cli).|
|`--tenant`|`-t`|Yes|Tenant. e.g `my-tenant`. Meaning, the name of your organization. Which you can find by visiting [flowcore.io](https://flowcore.io) | 
|`--bucket`|`-b`|No|Time bucket (YYYYMMDDHHmmss or first). This correlates to Year (YYYY), Month (MM), Day (DD), Hour (HH), Minute (mm), Second (ss).|
|`--eventId`|`-e`|No|Time UUID. This is the UUID of the event you wish to reset to.|

## Examples

To reset an adapter with a specific tenant and scenario:

```sh
flowcore reset adapter adapter-name -t tenant-name -s scenario-name -b 20240718110000
```

To reset an adapter using the first time bucket:

```sh
flowcore reset adapter adapter-name -t tenant-name -s scenario-name -b first
```

To reset an adapter using a specific event ID:

```sh
flowcore reset adapter adapter-name -t tenant-name -s scenario-name -e 9cb35da2-ba64-4bb5-86d6-ef20ebc62ab7
