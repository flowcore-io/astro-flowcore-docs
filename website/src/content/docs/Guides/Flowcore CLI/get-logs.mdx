title: Get Logs
description: Get logs from your deployed adapters using the Flowcore CLI
---

To get logs for a specific adapter, you first need to look up the adapters within a scenario. Use the following command, replacing the tenant and scenario names with your specific values:

```sh
flowcore get adapters --tenant my-tenant --scenario my-scenario
```

:::note
If you want to know more about fetching adapters or other resources, check out the [get resources guide](/guides/flowcore-cli/get-resources-cli/).
:::

After running that command, you'll see a list of adapters along with their adapter IDs. Once you have the adapter ID, you can retrieve the logs using the following command:

```sh
flowcore logs adapter <adapter-id> --scenario my-scenario --tenant my-tenant
```

Make sure to replace **\<adapter-id\>** with the actual adapter ID you found from the previous command, and adjust the scenario and tenant names as needed.

Doing this, will result in a stream of logs being printed to the console.
