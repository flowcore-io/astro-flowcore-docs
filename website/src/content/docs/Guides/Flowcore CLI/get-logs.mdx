description: Get logs from your deployed adapters using the Flowcore CLI
---

You can retrieve logs for a specific service in Flowcore using the Flowcore CLI. This allows you to monitor and troubleshoot your deployments effectively.

## Get Adapter Logs

To get logs for an adapter, you can use the `flowcore logs adapter` command. This command will retrieve the logs for the specified adapter.

```sh
flowcore logs adapter ADAPTER -s <scenario> -t <tenant> [flags]
```

Replace `ADAPTER` with the name or ID of your adapter. You can obtain your adapter ID by following the instructions in the [get resources guide](/guides/flowcore-cli/get-resources-cli/).

### Flags

|argument|abbreviation|required|description|
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|`--scenario`|`-s`|Yes|The scenario the adapter resides in.|
|`--tenant`|`-t`|Yes|Tenant name (e.g., `my-tenant`). This is the name of your organization, which you can find by visiting [flowcore.io](https://flowcore.io).|
|`--follow`|`-f`|No|Follow the log output (similar to `tail -f`).|
|`--json`|`-j`|No|Output logs in JSON format.|
|`--limit`|`-l`|No|Limit the number of log entries returned. Default is 1000.|
|`--profile`|N/A|No|Specify the configuration profile to use.|

## Examples

To get logs for an adapter with a specific tenant and scenario:

```sh
flowcore logs adapter adapter-name -t tenant-name -s scenario-name
```

To follow the log output in real-time:

```sh
flowcore logs adapter adapter-name -t tenant-name -s scenario-name -f
```

To limit the number of log entries returned:

```sh
flowcore logs adapter adapter-name -t tenant-name -s scenario-name -l 100
```

To output logs in JSON format:

```sh
flowcore logs adapter adapter-name -t tenant-name -s scenario-name --json
```

:::note
Remember to replace `adapter-name`, `tenant-name`, and `scenario-name` with your specific values.

## Additional Information

Before retrieving logs, you may need to look up the adapters within a scenario. Use the following command:

```sh
flowcore get adapters --tenant my-tenant --scenario my-scenario
```

This will provide you with a list of adapters and their corresponding adapter IDs, which you can then use with the `logs adapter` command.
