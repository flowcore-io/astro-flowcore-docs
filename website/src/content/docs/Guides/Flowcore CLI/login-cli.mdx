The Flowcore CLI uses your Flowcore account to authenticate and authorize you to perform various actions. This guide will
show you how to login with your Flowcore account.

## Login with the Flowcore CLI

You can login with the Flowcore CLI using the following command.

```bash
flowcore login
```

This will open a browser window and prompt you to login with your Flowcore account. Once you have logged in, you can close
the browser window and return to the terminal.

<Card title="Port" icon="information">
    If you are hosting something on the port that the Flowcore CLI wants to use, you can specify a different port using
    the configuration command. Running the following command will prompt you to enter a new port number.

    ```bash
    flowcore config set --port
    ```

## Login with Client Credentials (Service Account)

You can also login with the client credentials flow using the following command.

```bash
flowcore config set -c <client_id> -n <client_secret>
```

This will set the client ID and client secret in the configuration file. You can then use the following command to login

```bash
flowcore login
```

If you do not want to override the existing configuration, you can use the `FLOWCORE_CLIENT_ID` and `FLOWCORE_CLIENT_SECRET` environment variables.
They will always have precedence over the configuration file.

```bash
export FLOWCORE_CLIENT_ID=<client_id>
export FLOWCORE_CLIENT_SECRET=<client_secret>

flowcore login
```

<Card title="Early Access" icon="information">
  This feature is currently in early access, to get access to the client credentials flow, you need to contact the Flowcore team. Please contact us at support@flowcore.com to request access.

  This functionality requires version `2.12.0` or higher.
