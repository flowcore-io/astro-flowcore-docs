You can manage API keys in Flowcore using the Flowcore CLI.

## Create API Key

To create an API key, you can use the `flowcore api-key create` command. This command will create an API key and print the API key to the console.

```sh
flowcore auth new key --tenant <tenant-name> <key-name>
```

You will need to store the API key in a secure location, as it will not be shown again.

## Delete API Key

To delete an API key, you can use the `flowcore api-key delete` command. This command will delete an API key, and you will be prompted to confirm the deletion.

```sh
flowcore auth delete key --tenant <tenant-name> <key-name>
```

## List API Keys

To list all API keys, you can use the `flowcore api-key list` command. This command will list all API keys in the tenant.

```sh
flowcore auth list keys --tenant <tenant-name>
```
