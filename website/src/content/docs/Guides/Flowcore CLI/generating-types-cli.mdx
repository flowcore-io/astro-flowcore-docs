description: Generate types for your Flowcore project from your streams
---

You can generate types for your Flowcore project from your streams using the Flowcore CLI.

## Installation

You can install this plugin to the Flowcore CLI by running the following command:

```sh
flowcore plugins install @flowcore/cli-plugin-types
```

## JSON Schema

You can generate a JSON Schema from your Flowcore streams using the `flowcore types <STREAM>` command. This command will generate a JSON Schema for using a collection of events from a stream.

```sh
flowcore types <STREAM> --last <N> --directory <DIRECTORY>
```

This command will generate a JSON Schema from a collection of events from a stream prioritzing more recent events over older events.

:::note
  The `N` is the number of events to use to generate the types.
:::

:::note
  The `DIRECTORY` is the directory to output the types to, the file will be named based on the Event Type.
:::

## TypeScript Types

You can generate TypeScript types for your Flowcore streams using the `flowcore types typescript <STREAM>` command. This command will use the JSON Schema to generate TypeScript types for the events in the stream.

:::note[Typescript Usage]
  This requires the `@sinclair/typebox` package to be installed in your project.
:::


:::caution[Single Stream]
  This command only supports a single Event Type stream, not a collection of Event Types streams.
