Roles are the fundamental building blocks of permissions in Flowcore. Roles are used to group policies and bind them to users or API keys.

## Example Roles

Here's an example of a role definition that groups the `all-resources-read-write` policy.

```yaml
apiVersion: iam.flowcore.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  name: full-access-role
  tenant: my-tenant
spec:
  description: "Role for full access to all resources"
  policies:
    - all-resources-read-write
```

## Role Binding

Here's an example of a role binding that binds the role to a user and an API key:

```yaml
apiVersion: iam.flowcore.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: full-access-role-binding
  tenant: my-tenant
spec:
  role: "full-access-role" # References the role name above
  subjects:
    - type: user
      id: "3468415e-937d-47ee-9006-76159cd7f33e"
    - type: key
      id: "4326343d-efd2-4098-a90d-1ccde7597b1d"
```
