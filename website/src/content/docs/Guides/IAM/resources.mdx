Below is a list of all the resources that can be accessed in Flowcore, this will help you understand the permissions you need to manage.

### IAM Resources

- [Roles](/guides/iam/roles/) - Define roles and attach policies to them `frn::<tenant>:role/<resource-id>`, `read, write`
- [Policies](/guides/iam/policies) - Define permissions for resources `frn::<tenant>:policy/<resource-id>`, `read, write`

### Data Resources

- [Data Cores](/guides/architecture/primitives/#data-core) - Data core resources `frn::<tenant>:data-core/<resource-id>`, `read, write, fetch, ingest`
- [Flow Types](/guides/architecture/primitives/#flow-type) - Flow type resources `frn::<tenant>:flow-type/<resource-id>`, `read, write, fetch, ingest`
- [Event Types](/guides/architecture/primitives/#event-type) - Event type resources `frn::<tenant>:event-type/<resource-id>`, `read, write, fetch, ingest`


:::note

This list will grow over time as we add more resources to the platform that can be managed by IAM.
