Policies are the fundamental building blocks of permissions in Flowcore. A policy defines:

- What actions can be performed (e.g., `read`, `write`, `fetch`, `ingest`)
- On which resources, can be a specific resource (FRN) or a wildcard (`frn::<tenant>:<resource-type>/<resource-id>`, `frn::<tenant>:<resource-type>/*`)
- Principal (who is allowed to perform the action, this is a frn to another role, can be in the same tenant or a different tenant)

You can define a policy with the Flowcore CLI, or via the API.

## Example Policy

Here's an example of a policy that allows read and write access to all resources in a tenant:

```yaml
apiVersion: iam.flowcore.io/v1
kind: Policy
metadata:
  name: all-resources-read-write
  tenant: my-tenant
spec:
  version: "1.0.0"
  description: "Allows read and write access to all resources"
  policyDocuments:
    - resource: "frn::my-tenant:*"
      action: "*"
```

## Policy Binding

Here's an example of a policy binding that binds the policy to a user and an API key:

```yaml
apiVersion: iam.flowcore.io/v1
kind: PolicyBinding
metadata:
  name: developer-policy-binding
  tenant: my-tenant
spec:
  policy: "all-resources-read-write" # References the policy name above
  subjects:
    - type: user
      id: "3468415e-937d-47ee-9006-76159cd7f33e"
    - type: key
      id: "4326343d-efd2-4098-a90d-1ccde7597b1d"
```

## Specific Resource Access

Here's an example of a policy that allows read access to a specific resource:

```yaml
apiVersion: iam.flowcore.io/v1
kind: Policy
metadata:
  name: specific-resource-access
  tenant: my-tenant
spec:
  version: "1.0.0"
  description: "Allows read access to a specific resource"
  policyDocuments:
    - resource: "frn::my-tenant:data-core/5efa6713-d6dc-4574-9692-87096eca75f4"
      action: "READ"
```

## Multi Resource Access

Here's an example of a policy that allows read and fetch access to multiple resources:

```yaml
apiVersion: iam.flowcore.io/v1
kind: Policy
metadata:
  name: multi-resource-policy
  tenant: my-tenant
spec:
  version: "1.0.0"
  description: "Complex policy with multiple permissions"
  policyDocuments:
    - resource: "frn::my-tenant:data-core/*"
      action: ["READ", "FETCH"]
    - resource: "frn::my-tenant:flow-core/*"
      action: "FETCH"
```

## Policy with Principal

Here's an example of a policy that adds a principal:

```yaml
apiVersion: iam.flowcore.io/v1
kind: Policy
metadata:
  name: policy-with-principal
  tenant: my-tenant
spec:
  version: "1.0.0"
  description: "Policy with Principal"
  principal: "frn::other-tenant:role/6dbc8512-4990-46ab-8c56-1ffdbda83c8e"
  policyDocuments:
    - resource: "frn::my-tenant:data-core/*"
      action: ["READ", "FETCH"]
```
