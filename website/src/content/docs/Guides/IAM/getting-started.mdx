Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a core part of Flowcore. It is used to manage roles, and permissions that can be assigned to users, api keys and more.

## IAM Primitives

Flowcore's IAM system consists of several key primitives that work together to provide fine-grained access control.

Example resource notation: `frn::<tenant>:<resource>/<resource-id>`. Tenant is required, but the resource and resource id can be wildcards.

### FRN

Flowcore uses a concept called FRNs (Flowcore Resource Names) to identify resources. FRNs are unique identifiers for resources in Flowcore, and are used to manage permissions.

### Policies

Policies are the fundamental building blocks of permissions in Flowcore. A policy defines:

- What actions can be performed (e.g., `read`, `write`, `fetch`, `ingest`)
- On which resources, can be a specific resource (FRN) or a wildcard (`frn::<tenant>:<resource-type>/<resource-id>`, `frn::<tenant>:<resource-type>/*`)
- Principal (who is allowed to perform the action, this is a frn to another role, can be in the same tenant or a different tenant)

For example, a policy might allow `fetch` access to all events in a specific tenant, data core, flow type or event type.

### Roles 

Roles are collections of policies that are grouped together to provide a specific set of permissions. Instead of assigning individual policies, you typically assign roles to users and keys. Roles make it easier to manage permissions at scale.

Flowcore has a set of default roles that are created when a tenant is created. These include:
- `Owner` - Full access to all resources
- `Collaborator` - Read-only access to specific resources
- `Ingestion` - Only access to ingest data, can be useful if you want to generate api keys that only have ingestion rights to a specific tenant, data core, flow type or event type.

### Policy Bindings

Policy bindings connect individual policies directly to:
- Users
- API Keys
- Service Accounts (coming soon)

This allows for granular permission assignment when needed, rather than using broader role-based access.

### Role Bindings

Role bindings associate roles with:
- Users
- API Keys
- Service Accounts (coming soon)

This is the most common way to assign permissions, as it's easier to manage than individual policy bindings.

:::tip

  It's recommended to primarily use role bindings for permission management, and only use policy bindings for exceptional cases that require very specific permission sets.

## V2 Resources

IAM resources are defined using the v2 schema and can be defined using individual yaml documents.

see the following resources for more information:

- [IAM Resources](/guides/iam/resources)
