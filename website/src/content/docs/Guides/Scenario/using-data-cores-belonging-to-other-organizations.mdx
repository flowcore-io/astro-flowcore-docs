Data cores have [two visibility option - public and private](/guides/data-core/what-is-a-data-core). Each option is accessed slightly differently

## Private Data Cores
To access a private Data Core, you need to be [invited to the organization](/guides/organization/invite-user-to-organization) that owns the Data Core. That is it.
When you [create a scenario](todo), you can utilise any Data Core associated with your [currently selected organization](/guides/organization/switch-between-organizations)

## Public Data Cores
To access a public Data Core, [navigate to the public Data Core](/guides/data-core/navigate-to-a-data-core) you are interested in.

Then you press the `subscribe` button to add the Data Core to your list of available Data Cores. Once you have done this, you can use the Data Core in any scenario you create.
