The Data Core challenge shows you how to stream data from a Data Core in the Flowcore Platform. But first we need to setup the platform for the challenges.

## Challenge A
Now that you have ingested some data into your Data Core.

We can try to stream the data back onto your machine. This requires you to both find the stream url, as well as stream the data onto your machine.

Please, follow this [guide](https://docs.flowcore.io/guides/flowcore-cli/stream-cli/) to stream the data back onto your machine.

## Challenge B

Update your Data Core and scenario with a new Flow Type and Event Type.

<Steps>
<ol>
  <li>
    #### Add a new Flow Type, dedicated to the stream challenge
    Go to your existing `flowcore.yaml` file, and add an additional Flow Type

    ```yaml
    # flowcore.yaml
        stream.0:
          description: Contains the data for the stream challenge
          eventTypes:
            stream.challenge-b-solved.0:
              description: Collecting stream data for the stream challenge B
    ```

    So that the Data Core manifest section can look like this:
    ```yaml
    # flowcore.yaml
    dataCore:
      name: flowcathon
      deleteProtection: true
      isPublic: false
      description: This Data Core contains the data for the Application Flowcathon application
      flowTypes:
        ingestion.0:
          description: Contains the data for the ingesdtion challenge
          eventTypes:
            ingestion.challenge-a-ingested.0:
              description: Collecting ingestions for the ingestion challenge A
            ingestion.challenge-b-ingested.0:
              description: Collecting ingestions for the ingestion challenge B
            ingestion.challenge-c-ingested.0:
              description: Collecting ingestions for the ingestion challenge C
        # V- Add this Flow Type -V
        stream.0:
          description: Contains the data for the stream challenge
          eventTypes:
            stream.challenge-b-solved.0:
              description: Collecting stream data for the stream challenge B
    ```
    </li>
    <li>
      #### Add a new transformer to the existing scenario, dedicated to the stream challenge
      Go to your existing `flowcore.yaml` file, and add an additional transformer.
      ```yaml
      # flowcore.yaml
          stream:
            description: Stream transformer
            dataCore: flowcathon
            flowType: stream.0
            events:
              - stream.challenge-b-solved.0
            parameters:
              - name: PROXY_ENDPOINT
                type: manual
                value: >-
                  https://flowcathon.customer.flowcore.io/api/transform/stream.0
              - name: PROXY_HEADER_SECRET
                type: secret
                value: transformer-secret-flowcathon
            blueprint:
              artifactUrl: >-
                https://flowcore-public-runtimes.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/transformer-proxy-1.4.1.zip
      ```

      So that the scenario section of your manifest can look like this:
      ```yaml
      # flowcore.yaml
      scenario:
        name: flowcathon
        description: >-
          This scenario is used for development of the Application Flowcathon
          application
        transformers:
          ingestion:
            description: Ingestion Challenge
            dataCore: flowcathon
            flowType: ingestion.0
            events:
              - ingestion.challenge-a-ingested.0
              - ingestion.challenge-b-ingested.0
              - ingestion.challenge-c-ingested.0
            parameters:
              - name: PROXY_ENDPOINT
                type: manual
                value: >-
                  https://flowcathon.customer.flowcore.io/api/transform/ingestion.0
              - name: PROXY_HEADER_SECRET
                type: secret
                value: transformer-secret-flowcathon
            blueprint:
              artifactUrl: >-
                https://flowcore-public-runtimes.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/transformer-proxy-1.4.1.zip
          # V- Add this transformer -V
          stream:
            description: Stream transformer
            dataCore: flowcathon
            flowType: stream.0
            events:
              - stream.challenge-b-solved.0
            parameters:
              - name: PROXY_ENDPOINT
                type: manual
                value: >-
                  https://flowcathon.customer.flowcore.io/api/transform/stream.0
              - name: PROXY_HEADER_SECRET
                type: secret
                value: transformer-secret-flowcathon
            blueprint:
              artifactUrl: >-
                https://flowcore-public-runtimes.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/transformer-proxy-1.4.1.zip
      ```
    </li>
    <li>
      #### Deploy your manifest changes
      This is done, just like before, by running the following cli command:

      ```sh
      flowcore apply -f flowcore.yaml
      ```
    </li>

</ol>

</Steps>

Now that you have confirmed that you are able to stream data from your Data Core, lets try something a bit more challenging, [here](https://flowcore.io/flowcathon/flowcathon-mini-public#stream.0) is a public Data Core that you can stream from. Your challenge is to find a unique event (the needle) in this haystack of events. Then you will need to send that event id back to us.

Then you can post your event back to the `stream.challenge-b-solved.0` Event Type in the `stream.0` Flow Type in your own Data Core. The data needs to be in the following format:

```json
{
  "needleId": "<id in the needle payload>",
  "challenger": "<your name>"
}
```
