# 2. Data Core

## 2. Add a new flow type, dedicated to the Data Core challenge
Go to your existing `flowcore.yaml` file, and add an additional flow type
```yaml
    stream.0:
      description: Contains the data for the stream challenge
      eventTypes:
        stream.challenge-b-solved.0:
          description: Collecting stream data for the stream challenge B
```

So that the data core manifest section can look like this:
```yaml
dataCore:
  name: flowcathon
  deleteProtection: true
  isPublic: false
  description: This data core contains the data for the Application Flowcathon application
  flowTypes:
    ingestion.0:
      description: Contains the data for the ingesdtion challenge
      eventTypes:
        ingestion.challenge-a-ingested.0:
          description: Collecting ingestions for the ingestion challenge A
        ingestion.challenge-b-ingested.0:
          description: Collecting ingestions for the ingestion challenge B
        ingestion.challenge-c-ingested.0:
          description: Collecting ingestions for the ingestion challenge C
    # V- Add this flow type -V
    stream.0:
      description: Contains the data for the stream challenge
      eventTypes:
        stream.challenge-b-solved.0:
          description: Collecting stream data for the stream challenge B
```

## 3. Add a new scenario, dedicated to the Data Core challenge
Go to your existing `flowcore.yaml` file, and add an additional transformer.
```yaml
    stream:
      description: Stream transformer
      dataCore: flowcathon
      flowType: stream.0
      events:
        - stream.challenge-b-solved.0
      parameters:
        - name: PROXY_ENDPOINT
          type: manual
          value: >-
            https://flowcathon.customer.flowcore.io/api/transform/stream.0
        - name: PROXY_HEADER_SECRET
          type: secret
          value: transformer-secret-flowcathon
      blueprint:
        artifactUrl: >-
          https://flowcore-public-runtimes.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/transformer-proxy-1.4.1.zip
```

So that the scenario section of your manifest can look like this:
```yaml
scenario:
  name: flowcathon
  description: >-
    This scenario is used for development of the Application Flowcathon
    application
  transformers:
    ingestion:
      description: Ingestion Challenge
      dataCore: flowcathon
      flowType: ingestion.0
      events:
        - ingestion.challenge-a-ingested.0
        - ingestion.challenge-b-ingested.0
        - ingestion.challenge-c-ingested.0
      parameters:
        - name: PROXY_ENDPOINT
          type: manual
          value: >-
            https://flowcathon.customer.flowcore.io/api/transform/ingestion.0
        - name: PROXY_HEADER_SECRET
          type: secret
          value: transformer-secret-flowcathon-mini
      blueprint:
        artifactUrl: >-
          https://flowcore-public-runtimes.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/transformer-proxy-1.4.1.zip
    # V- Add this transformer -V
    stream:
      description: Stream transformer
      dataCore: flowcathon
      flowType: stream.0
      events:
        - stream.challenge-b-solved.0
      parameters:
        - name: PROXY_ENDPOINT
          type: manual
          value: >-
            https://flowcathon.customer.flowcore.io/api/transform/stream.0
        - name: PROXY_HEADER_SECRET
          type: secret
          value: transformer-secret-flowcathon-mini
      blueprint:
        artifactUrl: >-
          https://flowcore-public-runtimes.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/transformer-proxy-1.4.1.zip
```

## 4. Deploy your manifest changes
This is done, just like before, by running the following cli command:

```sh
flowcore apply -f flowcore.yaml
```


Data Core is a platform for building and testing Flowcore flows.

## Challenge A
Now that you have ingested some data into your data core.

We can try to stream the data back onto your machine. This requires you to both find the stream url, as well as stream the data onto your machine.

Please, follow this [guide](https://docs.flowcore.io/guides/flowcore-cli/stream-cli/) to stream the data back onto your machine.
