Welcome to Flowcathon! This is a workshop where you will learn the basics of the Flowcore platform.

## Communication
Generally, before the event starts, we will send you an email with the access credentials necessary to complete the challenges.

Alternatively, you can join [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/b9c7dRjR), to which we'll add a dedicated channel for the workshop, and give you access, in order to obtain the the necessary credentials.

:::note
If you choose to use Flowcore actively, then we recommend you to join our Discord server, as this is a fast way to get a hold of us - where you can ask for help, suggest features, promote your solutions and report bugs.
