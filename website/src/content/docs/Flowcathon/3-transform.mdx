To transform data in from any Data Core, you can use a transformer. You can read more about transformers [here](/guides/architecture/primitives/#transformer).

## Challenge A

Create a transformer on your local machine using any programming language you like, the only requirement is that it should listen for a post on an endpoint for example `http://localhost:3000/transform`. For the first challenge you can just echo out the data you receive.

To send data to your locally running transformer, you can use the following cli command:

```sh
flowcore stream http <stream-url> -d "http://localhost:3000/transform"
```

This will stream the events from your stream into your transformer, meaning that you can test your transformer locally with real data.

## Challenge B

Now that you have confirmed that you are able to stream data from your Data Core, lets try to transform the data of the [challenge-2C](https://flowcore.io/flowcathon/flowcathon-mini-public#stream.0) Data Core.

Your challenge is to find the unique event, that is hidden in this haystack of events, and use the information in that event to write the solution to a postgres database that we will provide you with on our [discord server](https://discord.gg/b9c7dRjR). Your credentials will only have access to write to a specific table called `af_transform`.

The table has the following columns:

- `id`
- `agent`
- `eye_color`
- `hair_color`
- `challenger`
- `postedAt`

:::tip
The agent name is the first and last name of the agent described in the event.
