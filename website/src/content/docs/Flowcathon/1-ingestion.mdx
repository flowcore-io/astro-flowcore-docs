Ingestion is the process of sending data to Flowcore, where it is stored in a data core.
The data can essentially come from any source, but in this case we will be focusing on data that it is ingested from your local machine.

    Before we can start to ingest data into Flowcore, we first need to create a data core. 
    
    Likewise, for the purpose of this workshop, we need to output the data to the [Flowcathon mini app](https://flowcathon.customer.flowcore.io/challenges/1), using a scenario. That way we can see the ingested data live within the app.
    :::note
      We will touch on the concept of scenarios, in the proceeding challenges.
    :::

<Steps>
<ol>
  <li>
    #### Obtain your tenant name
    Go to [flowcore.io](https://flowcore.io), and copy your tenant name. You can find your tenant name [like this](/guides/organization/switch-between-organizations/).
    :::caution
      If you have given your tenant a display name, then you will find your tenant name by looking at the drop down in the top left corner of the page, or by pressing "Settings", in your tenant profile.
    ::: 
  </li>
  <li>
    #### Scaffold your data core and scenario
    create a `flowcore.yaml` file somewhere on your machine, with the following content:

    ```yaml
    # flowcore.yaml
    version: 1
    ## ⬇️ INSERT YOUR TENANT NAME HERE ⬇️
    tenant: <your-tenant-name>  # The name of your tenant, this can be found by visiting your tenant page on flowcore.io
    dataCore:
      name: flowcathon
      deleteProtection: false
      isPublic: false

    ```

    :::tip
      It is also possible to create a `flowcore.yaml` file, by running the following commands:
      ```sh
      flowcore data-core init -t <your-tenant>
      flowcore scenario init -t <your-tenant>
      ```

      You can read more about it [here](/guides/flowcore-cli/create-resources-cli/).
    :::
    
  </li>
  <li>
    #### Create a transformer secret
    To the keen eye, some of you may have noticed something called `transformer-secret-flowcathon` in the `flowcore.yaml` file above. This secret is used to give you permission to output your data to the flowcathon mini app.

    Currently, the scenario will fail, because it cannot find the secret in your tenant. Therefore, we need to create a secret in your tenant, called `transformer-secret-flowcathon`.

    The secret value is provided by the instructors.

    Run the following command to create the secret:

    ```sh
    flowcore auth new secret transformer-secret-flowcathon -t <your-tenant-name> --from-literal <the-instructor-provided-transformer-secret-value>
    ```

    You can read more about flowcore secrets [here](/guides/flowcore-cli/auth-management-cli/).

    Please verify that the secret has been created, by [navigating to your tenant page](/guides/organization/switch-between-organizations/) on [flowcore.io](https://flowcore.io), press the "Settings" button, and scroll down until you see the secret.
  </li>

  <li>
    #### Deploy your manifest (resulting in the creation of a data core and scenario on Flowcore.io)
    Now that you have scaffolded your entire project, you can deploy your manifest with:

    ```sh
    flowcore apply -f flowcore.yaml
    ```

    When asked if you want to create your data core, say yes. Afterwards you will be asked if you want to create your scenario, say yes again.
   
    Once the command is finished, your scaffolded project manifest will have been setup in [flowcore.io](https://flowcore.io), under your tenant.
    Verify these resources have been created by:
    - viewing your data core under your [tenant page](/guides/organization/switch-between-organizations/), 
    - and viewing the scenario on the scenario page. *(which you can visit by pressing the scenario button on the left hand side)*

    :::tip
     To figure out if your scenario is ready and running, you can view the transformer logs from [here](/guides/flowcore-cli/get-logs/):
    :::
  </li>
  <li>
    #### Ingest your data 

    Firstly, generate an api key for your tenant, by running the following command:
    ```sh
    flowcore auth new key <your-api-key-name> -t <your-tenant>
    ```

    :::caution
      Remember to save the key, as it will not be shown again.
    :::

    This key is used to confirm that you are allowed to ingest data into your tenant. Please copy the key, as you will need it in the next step. You can read more about the api keys [here](/flowcore-cli/auth-management-cli/).

    Next, go to the [ingestion page](https://flowcore.io/f/ingestion-channels), and generate a webhook ingestion url, as shown in [the first section here](/guides/ingestion/ingestion-options/).
  </li>
</ol>
</Steps>

### Challenge A
Send some data to your ingestion url, and observe the data showing up on the [on the flowcathon mini app](https://flowcathon.customer.flowcore.io/challenges/2).
This can be done from your terminal, with something like curl.

For example:
```sh
curl -X POST "<your-ingestion-url>" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"hello": "bread"}'
```

:::note
  You can also verify that the data is ingested, by viewing your data core on [flowcore.io](https://flowcore.io).

:::

### Challenge B
Now that you have confirmed that you are able to ingest data, lets try to ingest data into a separate event type.
Try sending some data to your `ingestion.challenge-b-ingested.0` event type. To do so, please refer to Challenge A, as well as the prerequisites.

### Challenge C
Now that you have figured out how to ingest data into multiple different event types. You now need to process a .csv file into yet another event type, called `ingestion.challenge-c-ingested.0`.

So, what you need to do is this:
1. Download the csv file from the [flowcathon mini app](https://flowcathon.customer.flowcore.io/challenges/2)
2. Write a script (or use any method you like) to read the csv file
3. Send the entries in the csv file to your `ingestion.challenge-c-ingested.0` event type in the format of a json array like this:

```json
[
  {"Name": <name>, "Age": <age>, "Email": <email>, "City": <city>, "Occupation": <occupation>, "Challenger": <your name/identifier>},
  ...
]
```

:::tip
Flowcore also supports bulk ingestion, which means that you can ingest multiple events at once. You can read about it [here](/guides/ingestion/ingestion-options/).
