When you create a new account, a personal organization is automatically created for you, with the same name as your account username.

In general, this organization is used for your personal projects, development cycles and test use cases. If you want to establish a separate organization for a specific project or team, you can easily create one.

When you create a second organization, you are automatically added to that organization as a collaborator, with the role of `Owner`.

To create a new organizations, follow the steps below:

1. Click on your currently selected organization in the top left corner.
2. Press the `New Organization` button

3. Fill in the required fields and press the `Create Organization` button.
<Image alt={"The dialog that pops up after selecting 'New Organization'. This requests an organization name"}
       src={CreateOrganizationDialogImage}/>

4. After creating the organization, you will be automatically redirected to the new organization's profile page.
<Image alt={"The dialog that pops up after selecting 'New Organization'. This requests an organization name"}
       src={CreatedAnOrganizationImage}/>

If yours does not look like this for you. Then please try refreshing the page.
You should now see the new organization in the top left corner, and you can switch between organizations by clicking on the organization name.

Notice that you are automatically added to the new organization as a contributor, with the role of `Owner`. You can now [invite other users to the organization](/guides/organization/invite-user-to-organization) and assign them roles as needed.

The next step is to [create a data core](/guides/data-core/create-data-core) for the organization, so that you can prep for receiving data.
