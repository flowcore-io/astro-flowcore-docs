<Card title="GitHub" icon="github">
    Currently, we only support signing up with a GitHub account. If you do not have a github account, you can quickly
    create one
    [here](https://github.com/signup?ref_cta=Sign+up&ref_loc=header+logged+out&ref_page=%2F&source=header-home)
</Card>

1. Go to the [Flowcore](https://flowcore.io) app and click on the `Sign in` button in the top right corner.

2. Then proceed to log in with your GitHub account.

3. After you have logged in, Flowcore will begin to create your account, and you will be presented with a setup page. Just leave it to briefly do its thing and press `Complete Setup` when it's done.

4. You are now ready to start using Flowcore! ðŸŽ‰<br/>
You see something like this after you have completed the setup:

<Card title="Relationship between users and organizations" icon="information">
    It is **important to understand the relationship between users and organizations on Flowcore.** When you log in for
    the first time, a personal organization is created that matches your username.

    Please take a moment to look over the [how to create an organization](/guides/organization/create-an-organization)
    guide to better understand how organizations work.
</Card>

The next step is to either:
- [create a data core](/guides/data-core/create-data-core) for the organization, so that you can prep for receiving data.
- [create an additional organization](/guides/organization/create-an-organization) if you are part of a team and want to collaborate.
