The Flowcore CLI allows you to create resources in Flowcore using a manifest file. This is useful for creating multiple
resources at once, or for creating resources in a CI/CD pipeline.

## Data Cores

To create a data core, you can use the `apply` command with a manifest file. The manifest file should be in YAML format.

```yaml
tenant: example-tenant
dataCore:
  name: example-data-core
  description: "An example data core"
  flowTypes:
    - name: example
      description: "An example flow type"
      eventTypes:
        - name: example.event.0
          description: "An example event"
```

then run the following command:

```sh
flowcore-cli data-core apply -f data-core.yaml
```

this will create a plan to create the data core, and then apply the plan to create the data core.

## Scenarios

To create a scenario, you can use the `apply` command with a manifest file. The manifest file should be in YAML format.

```yaml
tenant: example-tenant
scenario:
  name: example-scenario
  description: "An example scenario"
  transformers:
    - name: example-transformer
      description: "An example transformer"
      dataCore: example-data-core
      flowType: example
      events:
        - example.event.0
      parameters:
        - name: PROXY_ENDPOINT
          type: manual
          value: "https://example.com"
      blueprint:
        artifactUrl: "https://flowcore-public-runtimes.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/transformer-proxy-1.1.0.zip"
```

then run the following command:

```sh
flowcore-cli scenario apply -f scenario.yaml
```

this will create a plan to create the scenario, and then apply the plan to create the scenario.

<Card title="Parameters" icon="information">
    <p>
        Parameters can be configured with a type of `manual`, `secret` or `variable`. The `manual` type is used for
        parameters that are manually set by the user. The `secret` type is used for parameters that are sensitive and
        are stored on the organization level. The `variable` type is used for parameters that are set on the organization level and
        are shared across all scenarios in the organization.
    </p>

## Apply all resources

You can also apply all resources in a manifest file at once by using the root `apply` command:

```sh
flowcore-cli apply -f manifest.yaml
```

<Card title="Delete Protection" icon="close">
    <p>
        By default, data cores are created without delete protection enabled. You can enable delete protection by setting
        `deleteProtection` to `true` for each resource in the manifest file.

```yaml
tenant: example-tenant
dataCore:
  name: example-data-core
  deleteProtection: true
```
        Keep in mind that if delete protection is enabled on a resource all nested resources will also have delete
        protection enabled. To delete a resource with delete protection enabled, you must first disable delete protection.
