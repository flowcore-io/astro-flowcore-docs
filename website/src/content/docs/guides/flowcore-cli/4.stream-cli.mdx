The Flowcore CLI allows you to stream data from Flowcore to your local machine. This is useful for debugging, development
and local exploration of your data.

## Pick data to stream

1. Navigate to the Data Core, Flow Type and Event Type you want to stream. Click on the `menu` icon and select
`flowcore-cli stream command`.

2. This will open a dialog with the command you need to run to start streaming data to your local machine.
<Image src={StreamDialog} alt="Stream dialog" />

3. Copy the command and run it in your terminal.

## Configuration

The default command will log out the data to the terminal. If you want to send data to a different location, you can omit
the `-o` flag and specify a `-d` flag to specify the http endpoint to send the data to.

To specify how many hours, days, weeks, months or years of data you want to stream, you can use the `-s` flag to sepecify
the start time to fetch events. The `-s` flag accepts a string in the format `1h`, `1d`, `1w`, `1m` or `1y`.

    You can also pipe the output to a file or another command by using the `>` operator.
    ```sh
    flowcore-cli stream <stream url> -o log -s 1h --json > output.json
    ```
