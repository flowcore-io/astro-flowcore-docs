The Flowcore CLI uses your Flowcore account to authenticate and authorize you to perform various actions. This guide will
show you how to login with your Flowcore account.

## Login with the Flowcore CLI

You can login with the Flowcore CLI using the following command.

```bash
flowcore login
```

This will open a browser window and prompt you to login with your Flowcore account. Once you have logged in, you can close
the browser window and return to the terminal.

<Card title="Port" icon="information">
    If you are hosting something on the port that the Flowcore CLI wants to use, you can specify a different port using
    the configuration command. Running the following command will prompt you to enter a new port number.

    ```bash
    flowcore config set --port
    ```
