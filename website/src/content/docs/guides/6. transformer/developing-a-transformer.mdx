# Using the NodeJS Template

To develop a transformer, you can use the NodeJS template. This template is a simple NodeJS application that you can use to develop your transformer, and then deploy it to Flowcore.

Go to https://github.com/flowcore-io/nodejs-typescript-transformer-example and click on the "Use this template" button to create a new repository based on the template.

## What is a Transformer?

A transformer is a piece of code that takes an event from a data stream and transforms it into some other format. A Flowcore transformer expects these HTTP endpoints.

- `/health`: A health check endpoint that returns a 200 status code if the transformer is healthy.
- `/transform`: The endpoint that receives the event data and transforms it.
- `/reset`: An endpoint that resets the transformer.

    If you want to retry events you can return HTTP status codes from the `transform` endpoint. 

    These are the status codes that you can return and the transform will be retried.

    `408, 429, 425, 429, 502, 503, 504`

## Pause the Data stream

If you want to pause the data stream, you can return a `429` status code from the `transform` endpoint. 

<Card title={"Retry-After"} icon={"warning"}>
    If you return a `429` status code, you need to also return a `Retry-After` header with the number of seconds to wait before retrying the event.

## Using the transformer

To use the transformer you need to specify a url to the runtime archive in either the Flowcore UI or the Flowcore Manifest.
