Data cores have [two visibility option - public and private](/guides/3-data-core/1what-is-a-data-core). Each option is accessed slightly differently

## Private Data Cores
To access a private data core, you need to be [invited to the organization](/guides/2-organization/3invite-user-to-organization) that owns the data core. That is it.
When you [create a scenario](todo), you can utilise any data core associated with your [currently selected organization](/guides/2-organization/4switch-between-organizations)

## Public Data Cores
To access a public data core, [navigate to the public data core](/guides/3-data-core/4navigate-to-a-data-core) you are interested in.

Then you press the `subscribe` button to add the data core to your list of available data cores. Once you have done this, you can use the data core in any scenario you create.
